# Hangman Project Instructions

Hangman is a classical paper and pencil game for two or more players which I am sure everyone played during
their childhood. The principle is quite easy. A player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by
suggesting letters. The player has limited number of errors they can make while suggesting a letter. In this
project, we are going to create a Hangman Game with the computer choosing a word and the user who must
find this word.
# How It Works

This program has two parts â€“ the logic of the game itself and the output to the user (represented either by graphical images as above or just plain text). This separation of the presentation and logic parts of the program makes it easier to update with new features or different designs. In professional software development, this strategy is an example of a software design pattern or software architecture, which concerns itself with how to structure your programs for easy under- standing and modification. This is mainly useful in large software applications, but you can also apply these principles to smaller projects.
